#I was going to leave an altered version of 00_clothes_triggers which removed vanilla references too, but I'm still figuring out the clothing side to making a total conversion. I can make it so everybody is naked (no clothes are used because none are valid to be used) as no vanilla countries or cultures are referenced, but then it would be just as much effort for you to re-add them all again.
