 KERBIN_POWERS_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Baskay, Arcadia has renewed its power and with it, their attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Arcadia's borders. The Sanctum Sovereignity has, historically, embarked on several daring military adventures - and is looking to regain its status, while the Universal Republic stands conflicted on its methodology in becoming a truly universal republic. Almost fourty years have passed since the end of the Nuclear War, and the world is yet again ready to push the button. Yet, what would this entail, in a war without any nuclear weapons?"

 0UR_KERBIN_POWERS_DESC:0 "The revolutionary war, which started in the previously capital of the old regime - the city now named Laythi, has laid the foundation of a new cantonal federation. A generation were born after the days of Zokesian invasion and the presence of the Arcadian threat.\n\nAnd now, as factionalism arises within the Republic, the question stands - Follow the federal tradition, or make true a future, which even the dead feared to see."
 0CT_KERBIN_POWERS_DESC:0 "Conflict has provided the old federation with a new vigour in the wake of the cabrian war. Consolidation of power and allies has now brought Tekkia to its greatest extent since the great war. But even now rising threats from rivals decades old and mere years cloud the future of the nation. \n\nPeace can no longer be kept through complacency, but the question lies in the best path to it."
 0AR_KERBIN_POWERS_DESC:0 "Commies are back"
 0KS_KERBIN_POWERS_DESC:0 "The Kalban States of Kerbia and Mentonogro are the remnants and successors of the original Kalban States, spanning most of the minor Baskay Bay. Despite past turmoil and civil war, both governments have managed to unite into a major power in the Baskay region. Although at first built upon non-alignment, the country's isolation in the face of the Arcadian Communist Bloc and the Universal Republic have forced it to adopt a militarized and interventionist stance towards the world. With one of the largest armies in Baskay, the Kalban expect intense conflict in the decades to come."
